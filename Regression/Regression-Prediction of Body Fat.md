Body Fat Prediction
Introduction:
Body fat plays an important role for a person being in good health. The risk factor is high when the body fat increases or decreases. Here we have taken a dataset by surfing through the internet. 
From the dataset we have done the data analysis by using linear regression. 
Description about prediction of body fat:
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The two variables used in this regression are called dependent and independent. From this dataset, we have taken two variables for dependent(BODYFAT) and independent(AGE).
We have created a data dashboard for body fat dataset and by using Jupyter Notebook we have analysed and predicted the values
