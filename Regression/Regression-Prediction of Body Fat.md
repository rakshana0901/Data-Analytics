Body fat plays an important role for a person being in good health. The risk factor is high when the body fat increases or decreases. Here we have taken a dataset by surfing through the internet. 
From the dataset we have done the data analysis by using linear regression. Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The two variables used in this regression are called dependent and independent. From this dataset, we have taken two variables for dependent(BODYFAT) and independent(AGE).
Storage fat is found in adipose tissues is called body fat. Age is a number of years that a person have live.
